# The Will to Fight - Game Overview

## Introduction
"The Will to Fight" is a strategic trading card game where players command armies in a morale-based combat system. Unlike traditional TCGs, unit power is directly tied to their morale, creating a dynamic battlefield where psychological warfare is as important as physical might.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Morale is Power
Every unit's attack power equals their current morale. As units lose morale, they become weaker, creating a death spiral that skilled players can exploit or prevent.

### 2. Two-Row System
- **Front Line**: Active combat units (5 slots)
- **Reinforcement Row**: Hidden units waiting to deploy (3 slots)

### 3. Delay Mechanic
More powerful units have higher delay values (0-4 turns), requiring strategic planning and timing.

### 4. No Resource System
Unlike many TCGs, there's no mana or energy. Instead, the delay system and turn actions create strategic constraints.

## Turn Structure

Each turn, players perform these actions in order:
1. Play one unit to Reinforcement Row (face-down)
2. Deploy one unit from Reinforcement to Front Line
3. Use Commander ability (if available)
4. Draw a card
5. Combat resolves automatically
6. End turn

## Victory Conditions

Win by either:
- Reducing opponent's Overall Army Morale to 0
- Defeating the opponent's Commander (if implemented)

## Unique Features

### Unit Reinforcement
Play identical units on top of existing ones to heal them, preventing morale loss and conserving board space.

### Position-Based Abilities
- **Center**: Middle slot bonuses
- **Flank**: Edge slot bonuses
- **Synergy**: Adjacent unit bonuses

### Damage Types
- **Health Damage**: Physical wounds
- **Morale Damage**: Psychological attacks
- **Both**: Devastating combined assaults

## Current Faction: The Ashen Legion

A faction of battle-hardened veterans who gain strength from sacrifice. Their unique mechanics include:
- Units that become stronger when allies fall
- Resurrection abilities
- Morale restoration from defeats
- "From Ashes, Strength" theme

## Strategic Depth

The game rewards:
- **Positioning**: Maximize ability synergies
- **Timing**: Balance immediate needs vs. delayed power
- **Psychology**: Target enemy morale vs. health
- **Resource Management**: Hand size, board space, and army morale
- **Sacrifice**: Sometimes losing units strategically benefits you
