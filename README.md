# TCG game app with Cloudflare Stack

See [./game-rules.md], this is a card game based on morale and reinforcement instead of killing minions directly. There are currently (as of 7/8/2025) some issues with units balancing and attack power vs morale power.


[![Deploy to Cloudflare](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/cloudflare/templates/tree/main/vite-react-template)

This template provides a minimal setup for building a React application with TypeScript and Vite, designed to run on Cloudflare Workers. This version has been extended into a full-stack game application to showcase a broader range of Cloudflare technologies and modern frontend practices.

## Project Overview & Technologies Used

This project demonstrates a complete full-stack application built solely on the Cloudflare Developer Platform, complemented by a modern React frontend:

- **Cloudflare Workers:** Hosts the backend API and serves the frontend application.
- **Cloudflare D1:** A serverless SQL database.
- **Drizzle ORM:** A TypeScript ORM used for database interactions with Cloudflare D1, providing type safety and a query builder.
- **Hono.js:** A small, simple, and ultrafast web framework for the Cloudflare Workers backend API.
- **Vite:** Frontend build tooling and development server, integrated with Cloudflare Workers via the `@cloudflare/vite-plugin` for a seamless local development experience that mirrors production.
- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript:** For static typing in both frontend and backend code.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for styling the application.
- **shadcn/ui:** Beautifully designed, accessible UI components built with Radix UI and Tailwind CSS.
- **Wouter:** A minimalist routing library for React.
- **TanStack Query (React Query):** For data fetching, caching, and state management on the frontend, interacting with the Hono API.
